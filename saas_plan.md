# SaaS Product Plan: friends.washodo.tv

## 1. Vision
Transform the internal streamer status tool into a consumer-facing SaaS platform where Twitch streamers and viewers can track their specific circles of friends in real-time, with high-visibility widgets for growth and monetization.

## 2. Core Architecture Shift
The system must move from a static, hardcoded configuration to a dynamic, data-driven application.

### Data Model
- **Users**: Auth via Twitch OAuth, subscription status (Free/Paid), settings.
- **Groups**: Custom lists of Twitch usernames.
    - *Free Tier*: Must include the "Washodo Members" base list.
    - *Paid Tier*: Full control over group members.
- **Streamer Cache**: A centralized database table storing the latest status, thumbnails, and profile info of all tracked streamers to minimize Twitch API calls.
- **Analytics**: Track impressions and clicks per widget/group.
- **Notification Destinations**: Webhook URLs and email preferences for status alerts.

### Tech Stack Evolution
- **Backend**: Transition to a full API (Express) with a persistent database (better-sqlite3).
- **Frontend**: Implementation of a User Dashboard for group management.
- **Real-time**: Implementation of WebSockets or optimized polling for the OBS browser source.
- **Notifications**: Generic Webhook Dispatcher and transactional email integration.

## 3. Tiered Feature Model

| Feature | Free Tier | Paid Tier (Premium) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Group Logic** | Must include "Washodo Members" | 100% Custom Friend Groups |
| **Streamer Limit** | Capped number of friends | Unlimited friends |
| **Customization** | Standard Washodo Themes | Custom Colors, Fonts, and Branding |
| **Privacy** | Public Widgets | Private/Password-Protected Views |
| **Analytics** | Basic view counts | Detailed engagement tracking |
| **Notifications** | Basic Webhooks | Advanced Templates & Email Alerts |

## 4. Widget Ecosystem & Viral Marketing
The product grows by being visible on the platforms where the users already are.

### Distribution Channels
- **Twitch About Page**: Embeddable HTML/JS snippets for panel integration.
- **OBS Browser Source**: A dedicated, transparent overlay designed specifically for live streams. Must update in real-time without manual refreshes.
- **Social/Linktree/Email**: Dynamic "Status Badges" (small images or iframes) that show how many friends are currently live.
- **Viral Loop**: Every free widget contains a "Powered by friends.washodo.tv" link, driving new users back to the landing page.

## 5. Engagement & Analytics
To measure success and provide value to paid users, the system will track:
- **Widget Impressions**: How many times a specific widget was loaded (e.g., how many people saw the OBS overlay).
- **Click-through Rate (CTR)**: How many people clicked a streamer's name in a widget to visit their channel.
- **Page Views**: Tracking visits to the public `/status/[groupId]` pages.
- **Conversion Tracking**: Monitoring the journey from "Widget Click" $\rightarrow$ "Landing Page" $\rightarrow$ "Sign Up".

## 6. Expansion: Notification Gateway
Transform the status tool into a monitoring suite that pushes data to other platforms.

### Generic Webhook Dispatcher
- **Platform Agnostic**: Support for Discord, Slack, MS Teams, Mattermost, and custom endpoints.
- **Payload Templates**: User-definable JSON templates with variables (e.g., `{{streamer}} is now LIVE!`).
- **Transition Triggers**: Dispatch alerts only on status changes (Offline $\rightarrow$ Online).

### Email Integration
- **Transactional Email**: Use of API-based providers (e.g., SendGrid/Postmark) for reliable delivery.
- **Alerts**: Email notifications for high-priority streamer updates.

## 7. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: The Foundation
